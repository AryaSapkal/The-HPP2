# The-HPP2

The Hallway Programming Project (HPP) is an open-source initiative that aims to accelerate student achievement at schools globally through rigorous matching and student engagement tools. Our target market is Initially started as a passion project to relieve congestion in crowded high school hallways through better course planning, the HPP may focus on meeting the needs of principals and administrators of low- to middle- income schools that are looking for ways to use the power of AI to automate student-course assignments and do other things to accelerate student learning. Market research will have to tell where this project goes!

Our goals are to reach at least 1,000 schools (low-income, preferably) in one year with donor-backed software that can take student, teacher, course, building, and miscellaneous data and make a simple, all-in-one school solution for student achievement. The HPP is a significantly cheaper option than current offerings, whose costs for schools can exceed $100,000 per solution. Keeping operating costs low will be essential to manifesting our vision.

The HPP will start with student-course assignments and then build from there to create a one-stop-shop for school management. In the future the HPP may pivot in its goals in order to better serve the problems of schools and todayâ€™s education, especially online. AI will be an integral part of the project, so expect a lot of that!

If you are a developer or leader, come join us! Let's collaborate to offer this valuable tool to schools worldwide and empower students to reach their full potential.
